# DNOTEBOOK
**Dnotebook** allows you to create and share pages that contain live code, text and visualizations in a textbook-like manner.


> We are redesigning Dnotebook to feel more native. Track progress in this epic [issue](https://github.com/javascriptdata/dnotebook/issues/10), [project board](https://github.com/javascriptdata/dnotebook/projects/1).

### Features:
- Easily perform interactive data exploration and analysis using efficient JavaScript packages like Danfo.js.
- Easily build, train and prototype machine learning models using different tools like Tensorflow.js
- Learn JavaScript in an interactive/visual style. This can hasten learning and understanding.
- Plain Experimentation/Prototyping. Any experimentation performed in JavaScript can run on Dnotebooks.
