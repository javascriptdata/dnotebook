# DNOTEBOOK
**Dnotebook** allows you to create and share pages that contain live code, text and visualizations in a textbook-like manner.

### It helps you to:
- Easily perform interactive data exploration and analysis using efficient JavaScript packages like Danfo.js.
- Easily build, train and prototype machine learning models using different tools like Tensorflow.js
- Learn JavaScript in an interactive/visual style. This can hasten learning and understanding.
- Plain Experimentation/Prototyping. Any experimentation performed in JavaScript can run on Dnotebooks.
